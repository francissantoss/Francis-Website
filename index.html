        <p class="lead mb-4">In middle school, my eighth-grade teacher had given me a letter that told me about an invitation to a meeting about this program. I wasn’t sure whether to show up, but my mom was interested and my friends as well, so I decided to give it a try. I went to the meeting and a spokesperson gave us a presentation about AVID. I felt relieved when she told us that the AVID program was where I will be attending high school, so I signed up. In freshman year, my AVID teacher taught us how to write notes when a teacher from other classes gives a lecture. Also, she helped me a lot because I was not a very organized student. My AVID teacher told me that a binder and dividers would be the best way to be organized and keep on track of my work. After the school day finished, I did what she had suggested and it helped not only me but also my AVID classmates. Taking notes is required in AVID. As a freshman, I started taking five notes.. In junior year, it was easy taking ten notes, but not five, although I did end up adapting to it. <br><br>
        I have made my community a better place by being on the Youth Council for the North Fair Oaks Community Council. In NFO Community Council, we provide recommendations on issues of community health, safety, welfare, public works and planning for the NFO community. I've been a youth council member for almost a year and it has made me learn new things. I got involved in NFO because someone who was previously the youth council member asked me if I cared about my community and I answered back with a ‘‘yes’’ because I had noticed some changes in my community that I disagree with and would like to change. Since I was little, I have participated in events like their yearly festivals and clean-ups.<br><br>
        When I got into my position, I wanted to put in my effort to make my community a place that everyone would consider as their home. I have learned numerous lessons when I began as a youth council member. I know I will use all of this learning in the future. One of the first things I learned is not everything can be decided instantly. When the rest of the council members and I meet before the meeting starts, we read through what the presenters are proposing and wait until they present. Some of these proposals are complex and need more time to discuss. For example, a businessman who wanted to propose remodeling and an additional parking lot for his restaurant. Some of the residences who lived near the restaurant were worried about the business man’s proposal, so they shared their opinions. This made the council members and me continue this topic for the next meeting, so that we could have more time to discuss and offer our final decisions.
